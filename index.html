        <p> Mark Rothko, born Markus Yakovlevich Rothkowitz, 
          was a Latvian-born American abstract painter. 
          He is best known for his color field paintings that depicted 
          irregular and painterly rectangular regions of color, 
          which he produced from 1949 to 1970. His paintings 
          can be interpreted to symbolize a wide variety of human emotions. 
          The yellow rectangle in this painting can be seen to symbolize happiness,
           and the orange one can be seen to symbolize enjoyment.</p>
